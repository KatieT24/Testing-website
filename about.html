    <h2>About The Graveyard of Three</h2>
    <p>The Graveyard of Three is about a small group that serches for odd coincidences of Three Tombstones that pop up
        in small towns and always has the different names, different deaths, and different kinds of death. </p>
    <h3>John Doe: Head Resercher on the Supernatural</h3>
    <p>John Doe is the head resercher of the group and tries to find out why three tombstone would pop up in certain towns. He would 
        often make sure to reserch and find out how these three tombstone would come about
        and report on their strange appearances such as small rock rings nearby that would appear alongside the 
        tombstones that would eurupt fromt he ground.

    <h3>Jacob Harris: Folklore specialist</h3>
    <p>Jacob Harris is a folklore resercher and specialist of the supernatural and when he heard about
        the appeances of the strange phenomenon of the Three Tombstones, he jumped at the chance to 
        study how they came to be. He makes sure to map out the areas that the tombstomes would come about and would often claim
        that it could be the work of something not of this world. Accourding to his theories, such rituals and the history of '3' date back to old supernatural times.
        He theorizes that there could be Fae that is invovled.

    <h3>Ellie Williams: Graveyard Specialist </h3>
    <p>Ellie Williams has always been living in graveyards since she was a small child, and she knows her way around them.
        She would often try and figure out about what materials were needed for the Tombstones as well and digging 
        through the grave site of the three to find out if there are indeed coffins buried. Unfortunately, no coffins or bodies have been buried at these sites 
        and she belives that whiole there could be supernatural hands at play, there is always the possabilities of interferances.
        She is the more skeptical one of the three but she enjoys working with John and Jacob as they have been serching for 
        many reason why these anomalies are popping up eveywhere in the states.
